            <p>The main plot of the game is split into nine "arcs" which are basically just separate sections of story content.
            The game begins with a scene of our protagonist, Ren, seemingly robbing a casino. After a few tutorial fights, and a very
            flashy leap through a stained class window, he is apprehended by a large crowd of police officers. One of the officers 
            even mentions that Ren was "sold out" by one of his allies. Ren is drugged and brought to an interrogation room, where 
            the player is given the opportunity to name him. Eventually Ren is interrogated by a prosecutor named Sae Niijima. 
            They talk for a bit, and Ren agrees to tell Sae the story of how he got to this point. This is when we learn that 
            the vast majority of the game takes place in a flashback, framed as Ren descibing his experience to Sae. We flash 
            back to around the beginning of April, in around modern-day Tokyo. We learn that Ren was falsely accused of assault, 
            and has been put on probation for a year. He has been assigned to live with Sojiro Sakura, who owns and runs a cafe 
            near his home called Leblanc. Sojiro takes Ren to enroll in the nearby Shujin Academy, which is where the game's first
            arc in centered around. Here, the player is intoduced to Ren's homeroom teacher, Kawakami, and Kamoshida, who teaches PE
            and is also the coach of the volleyball team. A few times throughout the day, Ren notices a strange app on his phone. 
            Its logo resembles an unnerving red eye, and the app seems<br> to reinstall itself every time Ren removes it.</p>
